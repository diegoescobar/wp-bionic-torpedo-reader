"Bionic Reading is a new method of reading that creates the artificial fixation points in the words thereby guiding our eye through the text. It highlights the first 2/3/4 letters of the word (depending on the word) so that our eyes read-only on the highlighted letters and our brain understands the whole word.Jun 5, 2022"
